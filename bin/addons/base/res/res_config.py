class res_config_installer(osv.osv_memory):
    """ New-style configuration base specialized for addons selection
    and installation.

    Basic usage
    -----------

    Subclasses can simply define a number of _columns as
    fields.boolean objects. The keys (column names) should be the
    names of the addons to install (when selected). Upon action
    execution, selected boolean fields (and those only) will be
    interpreted as addons to install, and batch-installed.

    Additional addons
    -----------------

    It is also possible to require the installation of an additional
    addon set when a specific preset of addons has been marked for
    installation (in the basic usage only, additionals can't depend on
    one another).

    These additionals are defined through the ``_install_if``
    property. This property is a mapping of a collection of addons (by
    name) to a collection of addons (by name) [#]_, and if all the *key*
    addons are selected for installation, then the *value* ones will
    be selected as well. For example::

        _install_if = {
            ('sale','crm'): ['sale_crm'],
        }

    This will install the ``sale_crm`` addon if and only if both the
    ``sale`` and ``crm`` addons are selected for installation.

    You can define as many additionals as you wish, and additionals
    can overlap in key and value. For instance::

        _install_if = {
            ('sale','crm'): ['sale_crm'],
            ('sale','project'): ['project_mrp'],
        }

    will install both ``sale_crm`` and ``project_mrp`` if all of
    ``sale``, ``crm`` and ``project`` are selected for installation.

    Hook methods
    ------------

    Subclasses might also need to express dependencies more complex
    than that provided by additionals. In this case, it's possible to
    define methods of the form ``_if_%(name)s`` where ``name`` is the
    name of a boolean field. If the field is selected, then the
    corresponding module will be marked for installation *and* the
    hook method will be executed.

    Hook methods take the usual set of parameters (cr, uid, ids,
    context) and can return a collection of additional addons to
    install (if they return anything, otherwise they should not return
    anything, though returning any "falsy" value such as None or an
    empty collection will have the same effect).

    Complete control
    ----------------

    The last hook is to simply overload the ``modules_to_install``
    method, which implements all the mechanisms above. This method
    takes the usual set of parameters (cr, uid, ids, context) and
    returns a ``set`` of addons to install (addons selected by the
    above methods minus addons from the *basic* set which are already
    installed) [#]_ so an overloader can simply manipulate the ``set``
    returned by ``res_config_installer.modules_to_install`` to add or
    remove addons.

    Skipping the installer
    ----------------------

    Unless it is removed from the view, installers have a *skip*
    button which invokes ``action_skip`` (and the ``cancel`` hook from
    ``res.config``). Hooks and additionals *are not run* when skipping
    installation, even for already installed addons.

    Again, setup your hooks accordingly.

    .. [#] note that since a mapping key needs to be hashable, it's
           possible to use a tuple or a frozenset, but not a list or a
           regular set

    .. [#] because the already-installed modules are only pruned at
           the very end of ``modules_to_install``, additionals and
           hooks depending on them *are guaranteed to execute*. Setup
           your hooks accordingly.
